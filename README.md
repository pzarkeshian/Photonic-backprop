The MNIST handwritten digit database (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) is very common for testing machine learning algorithms. 
The MNIST dataset of handwritten digits consists of 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples. 
Each training example in the dataset is a grey-scale image of 28 by 28 pixels of handwritten single digits between 0 and 9, 
in which the handwritten digits are recognized.
This repository contains a file MNIST_data.mat created from this data set (which has been used in our codes within this repository) and can easily be loaded with MATLAB.
